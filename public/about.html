    <p>this is another web audio api experiment.</p>
    <p>It's purpose is to find out how feasible it is to use multiple devices to play back synth sounds, controlled by a single controller interface, only using web technologies</p>
    <p>Currently, it does not try to be clever in any way: Latencies are <b>not</b> corrected for, and only very simple mechanisms are deployed to check for
      connectivity problems.</p>
    <p>In contrast to my other hacks, this one does not use home grown javascript sound synthesis but the building blocks of the web audio api. This is done to reduce CPU load especially on mobile devices. Also, because I finally wanted to understand how this works.</p>

    <p>Here's a <a href="keyboard.html">link for the curious</a>.
